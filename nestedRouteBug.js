In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when working with nested routes and the `useParams` hook.  If you have a route like `/users/:userId/profile`, and you try to access `params.userId` before the component mounts, you will encounter a runtime error because `params` will be undefined.  This often occurs when trying to fetch data based on the userId within the `useEffect` hook without proper conditional checks.
